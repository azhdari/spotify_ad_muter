This script mute spotify when there is a playing advertisement and only works on MacOS

** new update **
spotify in newer versions will not mute in advertisement, you can't even set the volume to zero, so I set the volumen to 1 :-D
then after advertisement it will be on 100 but you can set it in arguments.

you should have `node.js` and `npm` installed

clone then run
`npm install`

then run

`npm start`

for max volume you can set it this way

`npm start 70`

volume can be from 0 to 100
